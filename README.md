# Replica-Fan-Controlling-with-LCD-Arduino-

This project focuses on creating a fan control system using an Arduino microcontroller and an LCD display. The system replicates a basic fan control setup where users can adjust fan speed and monitor its status through the LCD screen. The Arduino manages the fan's operation based on user inputs, which are displayed in real-time on the LCD. This project demonstrates the integration of hardware components and the use of Arduino programming to develop a functional and user-interactive fan control system.
